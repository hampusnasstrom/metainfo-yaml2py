# metainfo-yaml2py
A program for converting NOMAD metainfo YAML schemas into Python class definitions.

## Installation
`metainfo-yaml2py` is not yet on PyPI but you can install the latest version using:
```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/hampusnasstrom/metainfo-yaml2py.git
```
You can then run the program with:

```
$ metainfo-yaml2py <target file>
```

### For development
`metainfo-yaml2py` is currently under development and for installing and contributing you should clone the repository and install the package in editable mode (`-e`) using:
```
pip install -e .
```

## Example
Running `metainfo-yaml2py` on the following YAML file (with the `-n` flag):
```yaml
definitions:
  name: Example Schema
  sections:
    Activity:
      description: |
        A base class for any activity in relation to an entity.
        This docstring can span multiple lines.
      quantities:
        start_time:
          description: |
            The starting date and time of the activity.
          type: Datetime
          m_annotations:
            eln:
              component: DateTimeEditQuantity
        end_time:
          description: |
            The ending date and time of the activity.
          type: Datetime
          m_annotations:
            eln:
              component: DateTimeEditQuantity
    Entity:
      description: |
        A base class for any entity which can be related to an activity.
```

## Command Line Interface
```sh
metainfo-yaml2py --help
usage: metainfo-yaml2py [-h] [-o OUTPUT_DIR] [-n] [-p] yaml_path

positional arguments:
  yaml_path             The path to the YAML schema that should be converted to Python
